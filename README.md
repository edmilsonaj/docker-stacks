# docker-stacks

## For when I need something quick and easy

Every stack here assumes use of Traefik as the reverse proxy and is configured to use HTTPS by default. Check the [Traefik readme](traefik/README.md) before using.

Configuration should be done using `.env` files placed along the stack files. Example files are provided for all stacks.
